"14 ContributorsHurricane Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThose flowers I found you\nWere the truest red that I'd ever seen\n'Til you cut yourself on their thorns\nYou winced and I kissed you\nAnd I kissed your palms and we both laughed\nSo unaware of the gathering storm\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's gonna rain, it's gonna rain\n'Til the levee breaks\nA tidal wave of fear and pain carries us away\nAnother fight into the night\nUntil nothing else remains\nHow do we find harbor from the hurricane?\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow sheltered in shadows\nThe quiet song of your breath stirs the dark\nYour skin like a rose 'neath my hand\nAnd I can't keep from wondering\nWhy nothing good can ever stay\nWhy faith feels like a fistful of sand\n\n[Chorus]\nIt's gonna rain, it's gonna rain\n'Til the levee breaks\nA tidal wave of fear and pain carries us away\nAnother fight into the night\nUntil nothing else remains\nHow do we find harbor from the hurricane?\nIt's gonna rain, it's gonna rain\n'Til the levee breaks\nA tidal wave of fear and pain carries us away\nAnother fight into the night\nUntil nothing else remains\nHow do we find harbor from the hurricane?See Thrice LiveGet tickets as low as $42You might also like2Embed"
