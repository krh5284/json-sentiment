"13 ContributorsFalling Apart Lyrics[Intro]\nI'll follow you out of the dark\nI tried it my way but I keep falling apart\n\n[Verse 1]\nAll that I see, is the wickedness around me\nI refuse to believe, the apocalypse inside of me\nI can't even trust myself\nI'm burning in my skin\nStanding at the gates of hell, but nobody will let me in\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll follow you out of the dark\nI tried it my way but I keep falling apart\nI'll follow you, with all of my heart\nI'm tired of my ways 'cause I keep falling, I'm falling apart\n\n[Verse 2]\nI stand here again\nForsaken in a place\nThat feels like I can never win\nI'm reaching for a saving grace\nI can't even trust no one\nI need to rise above\nI don't think I'm good enough\nTo feel your perfect love\nSee Papa Roach LiveGet tickets as low as $41You might also like[Chorus]\nI'll follow you out of the dark\nI tried it my way but I keep falling apart\nI'll follow you, with all of my heart\nI'm tired of my ways 'cause I keep falling, I'm falling apart\n\n[Refrain]\nI'm falling, I'm falling apart\nI'm falling, I'm falling apart\nI'm falling apart\n\n[Bridge]\nYour love's a fire, it's alive and I'm burning in it\nI'm in the ashes of mercy; I'm covered in it\nI fall hard and you carry me\nI fall apart so you can set me free\nYour love's a fire, it's alive and I'm burning in it\nI'm in the ashes of mercy; I'm covered in it\nI fall hard and you carry me\nI fall apart so you can set me free\n\n[Chorus]\nI'll follow you out of the dark\nI tried it my way but I keep falling apart\nI'll follow you, with all of my heart\nI'm tired of my ways 'cause I keep falling, I'm falling apart\n[Outro]\nI'm falling, I'm falling apart\nWithout you, I'm falling, I'm falling apart\nI'm falling apart, I'm falling apart1Embed"
